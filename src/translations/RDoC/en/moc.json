      "questions": {
        "1": {
          "question": "What is RDOC?",
          "answer": "The dollar on chain, our first stable coin. It is pegged to the US dollar."
        },
        "2": {
          "question": "How do peg to the US dollar is guaranteed?",
          "answer": "The peg is guaranteed by the smart contract, the rules and incentives are aligned so RDOCs can always be redeemed for the same amount of dollars in rBTC. For more detail check our technical white paper."
        },
        "3": {
          "question": "How much it cost to mint or redeem a RDOC?",
          "answer": "You have to pay a fee of 0.1% to mint or redeem RDOC, in the next version you can have a 50% discount on fees paying the fee with the MOC tokens."
        },
        "4": {
          "question": "How much it cost to transfer RDOC?",
          "answer": "Its free, once RDOCs are issued Money On Chain protocol do not charge for transfers."
        },
        "5": {
          "question": "Can I store my RDOC/RIFPro/MOC in my TREZOR or Ledger wallet?",
          "answer": "Yes, you just have to connect your hardware wallet to Metamask o Nifty."
        },
        "6": {
          "question": "What is a RIFPro?",
          "answer": "A RIFPro is like a Smart RIF on steroids, in fact its value came from the amount of RIFs it represents on the Money On Chain smart contracts, the RIFs represented by a RIFPro are literally trapped inside the smart contract. The RIFPro is designed thinking about long term RIF holders, it pays a passive income in RIFs and it has a little bit of free leverage, the free leverage means that when the price of RIF goes up it goes up a little bit more increasing the amount of RIF you hold, and when the price of RIF goes down it goes down a little bit more, however this downside can be diminished by the passive income. Also receive some % from fee of the platform and interest that pays RIFX."
        },
        "7": {
          "question": "Are RIFPro completely risk free?",
          "answer": "No. The incentives are aligned so when the price of RIF go significantly down more collateral is added to the system to prevent liquidation and the RIFPro holders to lose money, more over the system is designed to make the BTC2X not the RIFPro to take most of the risk, however, in a black swan event the system could enter in liquidation and the RIFPro holders could lose their RIF."
        },
        "8": {
          "question": "Are RIFPro being able to redeem at any time?",
          "answer": "No, but typically you will be able to redeem your RIFPro for RIFs against the smart contract. But there are some market conditions where the collateral cannot be taken out of the system. In this scenario you will be able to sell your RIFPro for RIF or DoC in the decentralized token exchange (TEX)."
        },
        "9": {
          "question": "How much it costs to mint or redeem RIFPro?",
          "answer": "You have to pay a fee of 0.1% to mint or redeem RIFPro, in the next version you can have a 50% discount on fees paying the fee with the MOC tokens."
        },
        "10": {
          "question": "What is a RIFX?",
          "answer": "Is a leveraged position on RIF, so when the price of RIF goes up the price of RIFX goes up higher and when the price goes down it goes down lower. RIFX are a high risk product and you can lose 100% of your RIFs in unfavorable market conditions."
        },
        "11": {
          "question": "Can RIFX be redeemed at any time?",
          "answer": "Yes RIFX can be redeemed at any time no matter of market conditions."
        },
        "12": {
          "question": "Is RIFX a future contract?",
          "answer": "RIFX act like a future contract, it expires every 30 days, but there are no order books to trade it to, you trade against the liquidity pool form by all the RDOC in the system."
        },
        "13": {
          "question": "Is RIFX fixed leveraged?",
          "answer": "No, when the period starts the leverages is 2, but the leverage fluctuate with the price, you fix your leverage when you make your operation but the leverage for newcomers will depend on the current price and the start price of the contract.<br>IE: <ul><li>The price of RIF is 10k, current leverage is 2x. You buy 1 RIF of BTC2X. One week later the price of RIF is 40k. You have 80k.</li></ul>"
        },
        "14": {
          "question": "How the rate for the RIFX is calculated?",
          "answer": "Short answer it depends on the amount of RIFX issued the higher the amount the higher the rate, for further detail check our technical whitepaper."
        },
        "15": {
          "question": "How is rate paid by the RIFX?",
          "answer": "The rate is paid in full until the settlement date and fixed at current rate, if you redeem your RIFX you get a proportional of that rate back, depending on market conditions it could be more or less of what you paid, check our technical whitepaper for further details."
